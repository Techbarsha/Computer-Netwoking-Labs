1. How can you perform a port scan using Python?
2. Use the ipconfig /all command on a Windows machine to display detailed information about all network 
interfaces, including their MAC addresses.
3. Use the Arp -a command to display the ARP cache table on a Windows machine and identify the MAC 
addresses of devices on the local network.
4. Use the ping command to test connectivity between two devices on a local network by specifying their IP 
addresses. Interpret the output to identify any packet loss or latency issues.
5. Use netstat -e command to show statistics about your network connection
6. . Use the ping command to test connectivity between two devices on a local network by specifying their 
IP addresses. Interpret the output to identify any packet loss or latency issues.
7. Use the ping command with the -t option to continuously ping a remote host and observe the response 
times.
8. Use the netsh command to display the configuration of a network interface, including its MAC address, IP 
address, subnet mask, and default gateway..
9. How can user create Multithreaded TCP Server that handles multiple clients?
10. Use the tracert command with the -d option to perform a traceroute without resolving hostnames to IP 
addresses, providing a faster output without DNS lookups.
11. What command is used to trace the route to a remote host, displaying information about each hop along 
the path including packet loss and latency statistics.
12. How can you handle multiple clients simultaneously using sockets in Python?
13. Develop a C /Python code snippet to create a TCP server that listens for incoming connections on port 
8080 and prints "Connection accepted" when a client connects.
14. Write a C /Python program that creates a UDP client-server pair that sends and receives data using UDP 
sockets.
15. Write a C /Python program to implement the parity generator code from a given pattern.
16. Write a C /Python program to implement the parity checker code from a given pattern.
17. Write a C /Python program for counter generator.
18. Write a C /Python to implement CRC.
19.Write a C /Python program using stream oriented server using TCP port no. 3456.
20. Write a C /Python program using stream oriented clint using TCP port no. 3456
